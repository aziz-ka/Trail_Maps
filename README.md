<h1>Welcome to Trail Map brought to you by TAJ team (Tim-Aziz-John)</h1>
<h2>Trail Map empowers you to visually track and manage your outdoor hiking activities.</h2>


<ul>
<li>Create and share unlimited custom trails.</li>
<li>View all of TrailMap's user submitted trails.</li>
<li>Favorite other user's trails and save them for later.</li>
<li>Add notes to a trail to let other users know more about your experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a quick wireframe sketch drawn on day 1 of what we envisioned Trail Map looking like after 7 days of work.</p>
